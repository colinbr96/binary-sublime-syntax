# binary-sublime-syntax
Syntax highlighting support for viewing "binary" text files in Sublime Text 3

## Note:
This syntax highlighter does not support [actual binary files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file).
Rather, it differentiates the 1s from the 0s in a [regular text file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).

## Installing:
- Move `Binary.sublime-syntax` to `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User` if you're on Mac OS.
- Move `Binary.sublime-syntax` to `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User` if you're on Windows.
